{r setup, include=FALSE}

I will be using the `murders` data-set from the `dslabs` package. 
{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

Let's filter by State name; we are only going to look at states starting with the letter "M":
{r filter}
murders2 <- murders %>%
  filter(state %in% c("Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Michigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana")

Now, let's select a subset of the columns; we are only going to look at state, population and total:
{r select}
murders2 <- murders2 %>% 
  select(state, population, total)
head(murders2)
tail(murders2)
str(murders2)

Now let's arrange the data by state, by the highest-to-lowest total number of shootings, and the population:
{r arrange}
murders2 <- murders2 %>% 
  arrange(state, desc(total), population)
print(murders2)

Nowe we can see the total number of murders per state, ranking from highest number to lowest.

Next, let's calculate the mean total rate for each state. Let's also calculate the standard deviation:
{r summarize}
murders3 <- murders2 %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(average_total=mean(total, na.rm=T), sd_total=sd(total, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(average_total)
print(murders3)

We can now see the average number of shootings per state.
